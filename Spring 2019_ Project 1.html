<h2>Modifications and Clarifications</h2> 

<ul>
 <li> The project does not expect you to analyse accesses to memory. In order to generate correct code, 
      instructions that read from main memory should not be moved across instructions that write to main memory.
</li><li> Your schedulers are only allowed to change the order of the instructions in the input basic block. Your scheduler
     must not perform any other optimizations (e.g.: constant folding, common subexpression elimination, strengh reduction, or "symbolic execution").      
</li></ul>

<h2>Project Description: PART I</h2> 

THIS IS NOT A GROUP PROJECT! 
     Every student is expected to work on his own project. You may
     discuss overall design issues with your fellow students. Detailed
     discussions and/or code sharing is not allowed. The
     general rules for academic integrity apply.
<br><br>

Write three local instruction schedulers (single basic block) based on 
forward list scheduling. 
Your scheduler has to be able to accept the following 
ILOC instructions with their specific latencies 
given in parenthesis: <br>
  <ul>
  <li> arithmetic: <b><i> add (1), sub (1), mult (3), div (3)</i></b> 
  </li><li> memory <b><i> load (5), loadI (1), loadAI (5), loadAO (5),
  store (5), storeAI (5), storeAO (5)</i></b> 
  </li><li> I/O: <b><i> outputAI (1)</i></b> 
  </li></ul>
 
The posted ILOC simulator uses these listed latencies for the instructions.
<p> 

</p><h3> Code Shape Requirements </h3>

<ul>
<li>
  The register r0 contains the base address 
  (namely 1024) of the memory area during program execution. 
</li><li> 
  You cannot rely on any particular naming strategy of the
  registers. For example, a code may use r1, r2, and r4, but not r3.
  However, as mentioned above, r0 is a reserved register that is
  used for the base address of memory references. 
</li><li>
  Your dependence (precedence) graph has only to compute true-dependencies and
  anti-dependencies on registers in the ILOC code, i.e.,
  output-dependencies on registers can be ignored since they will be covered through other
  dependencies in all benchmark codes (see below) 
</li><li> Any read (load) memory instruction cannot be moved across any
  write (store) memory instruction. NOTE: loadI is an exception since
  it does not access memory, so you can move a loadI across a write
  memory instruction.
</li><li> output instructions cannot be moved across any write (store)
  memory instructions.
</li><li> For extra credit, also perform dependence analysis on memory loadAI
  and storeAI operations (true and anti dependencies) since the
  specified offset tells you the particular memory location that is
  accessed. Therefore, loadAI instructions can be moved across storeAI
  instructions if both instructions access different memory
  locations. A similar condition holds for moving outputAI
  instructions across write (store) memory instructions.   
</li></ul>

<h3> Deliverables </h3>

You are asked to write three different versions of a forward list
scheduler. The difference between the schedulers are the heuristics
used to select among READY instructions. Your executable should be named <i>scheduler</i>, and should allow
the selection of the three different strategies through command line
options (-a, -b, and -c). Your scheduler needs to read the input program 
from standard input, and write the generated
ILOC instruction sequence to standard output. 
The three versions are based on the following heuristics: 
<ul>
<li>
  longest latency-weighted path to root (scheduler -a &lt; test.iloc &gt; test-opt.iloc).
</li><li>
  highest latency instructions (scheduler -b &lt; test.iloc &gt; test-opt.iloc).
</li><li>
  a heuristic of your choice (scheduler -c &lt; test.iloc &gt; test-opt.iloc).   
</li></ul>

<b> You may use any implementation language that is supported on the
ilab machines. However, we only provide help with a C
implementation. </b>. There is some C code that allows you to read in
ILOC instructions and represent them in a linked list. A list of
instructions can then be printed to standard output. The provided C code
can be found in <b>~uli/cs415/projects/proj1/C</b> on ilab. Copy the
files over into your own directory, and say "make". This will generate
an executable called "scheduler" in your directory. This directory
also contains the file <b>lectureExample.iloc</b> from lecture 5/6. 
You can execute this program using our ILOC simulator (see information
where to find the simulator below). <br><br>

At a later time, we will provide a benchmark suite of ILOC programs that you will use
to evaluate the correctness and efficiency of your schedulers. 
The benchmark programs will be made available in directory <b>~uli/cs415/projects/proj1/benchmarks</b> on
the ilab cluster. These benchmarks 
will be the basis for your report. Each benchmark
program consists of a single basic block. <br><br>

You may test the correctness of the ILOC code generated by your
schedulers by running it on the ILOC simulator <b> sim </b> provided in
directory <b>~uli/cs415/ILOC_Simulator</b> on the:
<a href="http://ilab.rutgers.edu/"> ilab machines </a>. If you want to
generate the simulator on your own machine, the
subdirectory src contains the source code of the ILOC simulator. Note:
the simulator source code is not needed if you want to run your ILOC
programs on ilab. <br><br>

<h3> Benchmark Programs </h3>

There will be 20 benchmark programs posted at <b>~uli/cs415/projects/proj1/benchmarks</b> on
the ilab cluster.  This benchmark suite will be the basis for showing 
the performance differences of your three instruction schedulers. 
You may add additional benchmarks to showcase particular features of your scheduler. You will need to
describe these additional files in the ReadMe file for your project.

<br><br>

<h2>Project Description: PART II</h2> 

You will write a project report that discusses the designs of your
three schedulers and their performance on programs in the benchmark
suite. You should list the execution times of the programs produced
by your schedulers in terms of cycles as reported by the
ILOC simulator. Please 
include in your report a discussion of the advantages
and disadvantages of the different scheduling strategies. Particularly, your report should
include the motivation of your heuristic for the third 
scheduler. The report should be in PDF format and between 3 and 6
pages. Please use graphs to show your results.    
<br><br> 
 

<h2> Due Date </h2> 
Please see above.
If you have specific, overriding, 
personal reasons why these dates are unreasonable, you should discuss 
them directly with the instructor <b>before</b> the deadline. 
<br><br> 
 

<h2>Submission Procedure</h2> 

Please submit a single <b> tar-file  </b> with all your <b> source </b> files, including
the ReadMe file. Your ReadMe file may contain 
comments that you want the grader to know about. The grader has to be
able to execute your schedulers on the ilab machines. Do include any
additional benchmarks that showcase the benefits of your optional scheduler.
<b> Do not </b> submit your scheduler as an executable. <b> Do not </b>
submit the simulator, or the provided example programs. <br><br>

We will use the following <b> late policy </b>: You will receive a penalty of
20% of your overall grade for each day late. A day is a working day
(Monday through Friday). 

More details regarding the submission procedure will be posted later. 

<br><br> 


<h2>Grading Criteria</h2> 

Your scheduler has to run on the ilab machines. This will allow us
to perform automatic testing. <font color="red"> You will receive no credit if your
scheduler does not compile and/or execute on the ilab machines. </font>  
You should submit a ReadMe file that contains a description of how to
run your schedulers. <br>

<b> Your overall grade will be based on your code (60%) and your report
(40%). Show your work. </b>
